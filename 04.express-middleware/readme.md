# Middleware in Express:

Middleware in Express.js is a function that executes during the request-response cycle. It has access to the request (req) and response (res) objects and the next() function, which passes control to the next middleware.





- Built-in Middleware (express.json, express.urlencoded)

- Third-party Middleware (e.g., morgan, cors)

- Custom Middleware
